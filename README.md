Rob's start into the world of python

I'm a complete beginner to python and github. I'm starting a new position in sales for a machine learning startup specialzied in image processing and natural language processing. To be able to understand a client's problems and possible ways to solve them, I'd like to understand the very basics of programming in python and advance over time to initiate projects and evaluate the solutions from a client's perspective.
